## Test Project "Auth System" (ExpressJS + ReactJS)

#### Preparation
Install mongoDB server `https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community`
I am using now 4.2.6.
No need to create DB manualy, it creates automaticly due to fire RESTs.

#### How to use
Run this command in root, `server` and `/client` directories to install dependencies:

`yarn install`

That command starts both backend and frontend for developing on `localhost:5000` and `localhost:3000` respectively:

`yarn dev`

#### TODO
- [ ] Fix Prettier in `client/` folder (on save not working)
- [ ] Make Auth as a module sytem (reusable)
- [ ] Add bootstap 4 (dark theme)
