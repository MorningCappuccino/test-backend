## Test Project "Auth System" (ExpressJS + ReactJS)

#### How to use
`yarn install`

Run this command in root directory and in `client` folder.

`yarn dev`

That command starts both backend and frontend for develop on `localhost:3000`;

#### TODO
- [ ] Fix Prettier in `client/` folder (on save not working)
- [ ] Make Auth as a module sytem (reusable)
- [ ] Add bootstap 4 (dark theme)
